# @opcgdb/api

This is the main API to be consumed in other projects. It's still very much WIP

## TODO

- [ ] Add node server dev (watch) command
- [ ] Setup build process for the API (run prod from node and not vite-node)
- [ ] Update task dependency requirements for NX
- [ ] Write SST handlers
- [ ] Add API Token support (File based, S3? Path based? URL bases?)
- [ ] Write this README file (How to use)
- [ ] Write instructions on how to deploy in AWS Lambda
- [ ] Write instructions on how to deploy as Node Server
